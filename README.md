# WeatherApp-Android
Implemented an App that shows the weather forecast for a particular place that the user selects from Maps.

User can select a place of their choice from maps. Once it is selected, the app displays the weather forecast for the week for the given location.

There is also a change location button for changing the location for which the weather forecast the user wants to see.


The user selects a location from the Map.
